About the shared python file:

A thorough analysis on the country's daily reported issue taking lives of the population due to various factors contributing to the same. With the shared open datasets, we were able to drive our focus on the number of affected/dead people gender wise, vehicle wise, weather/road conditions and lane wise.

However, from the statistical point of view on the given open data sets, we were able to see the spikes and densed data points on the numbers giving us area to focus on to reduce the mishaps.

1.Upon analysisng the Year on Year total accidents, we found that the numbers were varying with tad bit of difference as they were all summing up to 25% per lakh pooluation for the years. **Maharashtra** and **Tamil Nadu** have the highest number of accidents.**Arunachal, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura** have the least number of accidents. They surprisingly all belong to the **north-eastern area.**
Maximum accidents happened in the year 2013 wherein the minimum accidents happened in the year 2016.

2. The percent of offenders died in male population constituted to 92.1% and female 7.9% whereas for the male victims died constituted to 83.6% and that of female was 16.4%. The death percent has been the highest among victims (75.55%) that too for offenders it is 24.45%

3. We had also driven deep for looking over the mishaps happening due to unimportance given to vehicle accessories where death happening due to non wearing of helmet for male summed up to 85% and that of female was 15%

4. The accidents cases rised from 2004 to 2016 with the big differnece and that needs to be investigated on various factors such as license approval, strict on road rules violations.

5. Also, looking upon the lanes in the respective states, accidents happening on lane 2 on avg is the highest , Goa being the top most state in this category. Maximum Injuries also tend to happen on Lane1 and Lane 2 where Kerala followed by Puducherry accounts for the  highest lane2 injuries that gives the government and area to focus on and look for the solutions to reduce this. Lane 4 also joins in for the number of maximum people killed in the respective states.

6. Accients, Injuries and deaths also happen due to various other factors such as weather conditions, under constructed roads, poor lights, boulders faultd and other unregistered reasons. However, Goa happens to be the top state where in the Accidents happen the most due to drivers fault and pedestrians fault, maximum injuries in Kerala and Deaths in Tamil Nadu.
Injuries due to pedestrians happen the most in the state of Goa which results to maximum deaths in the state.
We also analysed on the maximum mishaps happening due to vehicle's default and Manipur has a clear spike in this category for maximum accidents and injuries and killing followed by Chattisgarh.
Telanaga after Manipur has been showing the spike for the mishaps but the factor contributing here is due to bad road conditions. These two states also accounts the highest followed by Sikkim for the total mishaps due to bad weather conditions. North eastern states have also been listed for the maximum of accidents/injuries and killing due to poor lights in the state and Uttar Pradesh for passenger's default.
